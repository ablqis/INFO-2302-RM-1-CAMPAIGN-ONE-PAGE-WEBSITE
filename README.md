**Javascript explanation** 

> Hover effect on the title

The first code creates a hover effect on the element with the class .campaign-title. When the user hovers over the element, the text color changes to black and a text shadow is added. When the user moves the cursor away from the element, the text color reverts to green and the text shadow is removed.

> Click on Baqarah 2:261

This code adds a click event listener to the element with the bold text "Baqarah 2:261". When the user clicks on the element, the window is redirected to the Quran.com website, specifically to the page for Surah Baqarah, verse 261, with translations from various translators.

> Click on IIUM logo

This code adds a click event listener to the element with the class .logo. When the user clicks on the element, the window is redirected to the IIUM website.
